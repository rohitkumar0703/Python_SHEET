Multi words Variable Names 

Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.
There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

Camel Case
Each word, except the first, Start with a capital letter:
myVariableName = "Rohit"

Pascal Case
Each word starts with a capital letter:
MyVariableName = "Rohit"

Snake Case
Each word is separated by an underscore character:
my_variable_name = "John"

GLOBAL VARIABLE 
#Variables that are created outside of a function
(as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.

The Global Keyword
Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, 
that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.
To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.
