Built-in Data Types

In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:	           str
Numeric Types:	       int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	       list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	       dict
Set Types:	           set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	       bool
Binary Types:	       bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	           NoneType       


TYPE_CASTING:-

Python Casting
Specify a Variable Type
There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting.
 Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.

Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:

int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal 
(providing the string represents a whole number)
float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals
