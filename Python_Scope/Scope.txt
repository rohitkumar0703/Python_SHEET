A variable is only available from inside the region it is created. This is called scope.
Local Scope
A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function.

Function Inside Function
As explained in the example above, the variable x is not available outside the function, but it is available for any function inside the function:
Example
The local variable can be accessed from a function within the function:

Global Scope
A variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope.
Global variables are available from within any scope, global and local

Naming Variables
If you operate with the same variable name inside and outside of a function,
 Python will treat them as two separate variables, one available in the global 
 scope (outside the function) and one available in the local scope (inside the function):


Global Keyword
If you need to create a global variable, but are stuck in the local scope, you can use the global keyword.
The global keyword makes the variable global.
