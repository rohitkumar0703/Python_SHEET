# Python Logical Operator 
x = 5
print(x > 3 and x < 10)
# returns True because 5 is greater than 3 AND 5 is less than 10

print(x > 3 or x < 4)
# returns True because one of the conditions are true 
# (5 is greater than 3, but 5 is not less than 4)

print(not(x > 3 and x < 10))
# returns False because not is used to reverse the result
