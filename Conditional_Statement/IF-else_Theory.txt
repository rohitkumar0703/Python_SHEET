Python If ... Else
Python Conditions and If statements
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals:                        a == b
Not Equals:                    a != b
Less than:                     a < b
Less than or equal to:         a <= b
Greater than:                  a > b
Greater than or equal to:      a >= b

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

CODE----->
a = 33
b = 200

if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
Explanation....

In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the 
if statement to test whether b is greater than a.As a is 33, and b is 200, 
we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".

Example
If statement, without indentation (will raise an error):

a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
print("b is greater than a") # you will get an error
